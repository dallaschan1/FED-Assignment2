# ZenCraft - The Ultimate Furniture Gaming Experience

## GitHub Issues: 
- Due to some unknown reasons, the github deployed website does not function as well as compared to a locally deployed webserver. We had little time to figure the issue and therefore this issue wasn't resolved.

## Overview

Welcome to ZenCraft, an innovative fusion of online shopping and gaming. Our platform isn't just another furniture store; it's a unique experience that combines the thrill of gaming with the convenience of online furniture shopping. Dive into our exclusive game, reminiscent of popular titles like Agar.io, Surviv.io, and Tank.io, where players battle enemies, overcome challenges, and earn discounts on our wide range of furniture products. With each milestone reached in the game, players unlock special discounts, making shopping not just rewarding but also incredibly fun.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios

## Navigation and Checkout Testing

1. **Navigate through the site to test the user flow and interface.**
2. Click on any of the shop categories in the `index.html` should have transported you to the `shop.html` with the correct filtered category.
3. **Add items to the cart and verify:**
   - Deleting of cart items
   - Changing of cart items quantity
   - Cart items are still there when the cart is closed and opened again
4. Proceed to checkout with an empty cart and try to place an order. Verify that a relevant error message appears.
5. Proceed to checkout with a non-empty cart and try to place an order with all inputs valid. Verify that a success message appears.
6. Sent messages through the contact form to test its functionality and responsiveness.

### Known Issues

- **Game Mechanics**: Players may get stuck in obstacles due to knockback from enemy hits.
- **Image Upload Limitations**: High-quality images may cause issues during account creation or posting in the forum.
- **Database Reliability**: Occasional downtime with RestDB API can affect site functionality.
- **Lack of Image Resource**: Due to the lack of resources for the different product color variations, changing the product's color doesn't change the picture of the product to that of the same color.
